\chapter{Sketch of proof of [Theorem 4.2]}
Chatterjee presented the complete proof of [theorem 4.2] in his original paper,
where the samples drawn from $(X, Y)$ are i.i.d. \\
In our case of Markov chains, for the estimation of Chatterjee's correlation,
we have correlated but identically distributed draws due to stationarity. \\
To use the theory in reality, we need to estimate the correlation, and for that we need the estimator to be consistent in our case as well.\\
Our aim is to prove that the estimator is consistent even in the stationary Markov chain case.
We believe that the convergence should happen, but were not able to prove it completely during the UGP timeline. \\
Below we present [complete the sentence].
