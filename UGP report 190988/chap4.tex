\chapter{TODOs and Questions to ask in the meeting}

TODOs
\begin{enumerate}
    \item For intuition of Theorem 1.1, read 1910.12327 and [10].
    \item By Theorem 2.2, now we can think of estimating $\xi$ using a single Markov chain. Need to see by simulation how the estimates are if our data is not iid.
\end{enumerate}

Questions
\begin{enumerate}
    \item How does reversibility imply that the distribution of $(X_i, \dots, X_j)$ is same as $(X_j, \dots, X_i)$?
    \item If we leave out some of the indices while considering the joint distribution, will they still remain the same?
\end{enumerate}
